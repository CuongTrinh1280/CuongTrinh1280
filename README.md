- 👋 Hi, I’m @cuongtrinh a.k.a @impcuong, and I'm not a robot even sometimes I wished that might turning to reality, keke!
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of stuff, mostly learning new things with the curiostity and open-minded, feel free to say `hi`! 
Any low-level programmings (obviously not deep down into the kernel like embedded-system or any kinds close with that, even I do like it tho)
are the most attractive field that I have been immersed with.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning both Golang and Rust at the same time, furthermore is Kubernetes/Docker *===>* to DevOpsity and beyond!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source with the domain relevant with Golang or Rust, if you can teach me something, even you think it's trivial
I will appreciate its alot, show me my worst and both of us can be improved.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
